# SivsItemsRoR2
 A Risk of Rain 2 Mod that adds a variety of items.
 
## Enemy Items
 Enemy items are special yellow items that have a chance to drop from various monsters. Think of them as boss items but for individual enemies.
> Worker's Bond (Beetle): Having allies nearby boosts regen.

> Frayed Tentacle (Jellyfish): Chance on hit to tether yourself to an enemy, dealing damage over time.

> Mourning Geode (Stone Golem): Gain a burst of armor and regen on kill.

> Imp's Eye (Imp): Bleeding now lowers armor and movement speed.

> Frenzied Tarbine (Clay Templar): Striking enemies rapidly also hits them with a barrage of Tar bullets.

> Bighorn Buckler (Bighorn Bison): Damage enemies by dashing into them.

> Living Furnace (Elder Lemurian): Chance on hit to ignite enemies.

> Null Seed (Void Reaver): Annihilate all nearby characters on kill. Recharges after 30 seconds.

Version 0.0.2
- Added changelog
- Stacking Null Seed no longer increases AOE radius
- Rebalanced Mourning Geode to make it worth its rarity; Mourning Geode was initially designed as a standard White item, and had the stats to match. I felt that since it's a bit harder to get now, it deserved a bit more punch.
     - Initial Buff Duration: 1 second -> 1.5 seconds
     - Stacking Buff Duration: +0.25 seconds -> +0.3 seconds
